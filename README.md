HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX

PROJECT OVERVIEW:

The World Bank has a large database called the World Development Indicators (WDI). According to the World Bank, the WDI are a "compilation of cross-country, relevant, high-quality, and internationally comparable statistics about global development and the fight against poverty." This data is free and open to the public for use. The WDI database contains a vast array of socioeconomic indicators related to population, GDP, education, health, human rights, labor, trade, land use, and so on. The WDI is one of the most significant international databases and contains around 1300 indicators for almost every country in the world, with the earliest indicators starting in 1960.

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) collects and stores international data for monitoring and reporting on multiple human development indices, such as poverty, gender equality, sustainability, and so on. This project will focus on predicting the Human Development Index (HDI). According to the UNDP, "the HDI was created to emphasize that people and their capabilities should be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not economic growth alone."
