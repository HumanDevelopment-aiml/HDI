The Human Development Index (HDI) is a statistic composite index of World Development Indicators (WDI) which are used to rank countrie's human development.
There are several goals and indicators.I chose the topic "Poverty" and downloaded the datasets regarding the topic-Poverty.
In all these datasets there are Null values present in them.
For that I have run a program in order to find out the percentage of Null values in each dataset.
Results for that is:
adequacy_of_social_insurance.csv
Null : 83.50 %
alternative_poverty_percent_below_nationally_defined_poverty.csv
Null : 64.99 %
at_least_basic_sanitation_overall_access_percent.csv
Null : 1.52 %
at_least_basic_water_source_overall_access_percent.csv
Null : 1.23 %
coverage_of_social_insurance.csv
Null : 83.30 %
drought_affected_annual_number.csv
Null : 0.00 %
earthquake_affected_annual_number.csv
Null : 0.00 %
epidemic_affected_annual_number.csv
Null : 0.00 %
flood_affected_annual_number.csv
Null : 0.00 %
government_health_spending_of_total_gov_spending_percent.csv
Null : 1.10 %
govt_expenditure_education.csv
Null : 42.41 %
income_share_of_poorest_20percent.csv
Null : 64.72 %
income_share_of_richest_20percent.csv
Null : 64.94 %
rural_poverty_percent_rural_people_below_national_rural.csv
Null : 89.47 %
social_rights_equality_index.csv
Null : 0.44 %
storm_affected_annual_number.csv
Null : 0.00 %
tsunami_affected_annual_number.csv
Null : 88.19 %
urban_poverty_percent_urban_people_below_national_urban.csv
Null : 90.29 %
 In all these the datasets with 0.00 % Null values are all deaths.So there is no use of considering those datsets.
 And some datasets Null values percentage is much higher so these datasets are also of no use.
 Finally..,there are only four datasets remaining with very less Null values percentage.They are-
 at_least_basic_sanitation_overall_access_percent.csv
 Null : 1.52 %
 at_least_basic_water_source_overall_access_percent.csv
 Null : 1.23 %
 government_health_spending_of_total_gov_spending_percent.csv
 Null : 1.10 %
 social_rights_equality_index.csv
 Null : 0.44 %
 
 Further considering we can perform next steps.
 
 Next steps may be-
 
 Data Engineering: Scraping, merging, cleaning, and transforming data.
 Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing variables for correlation and regression to build final data frame(s).
 Prediction with Machine Learning: Using the final variables to build the models.
