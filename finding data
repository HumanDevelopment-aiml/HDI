One of the goals in SDG's is Quality Education.
I have gone through the indicators listed and checked whether they can be used or not.
For now, i have checked for % of null values in the datasets.
Turns out there weren't many indicators with less percent of values

These are the following indicators

edu\expenditure_per_student_primary_percent_of_gdp_per_person.csv
Null percentage : 54.05 %
No of countries: 163
edu\expenditure_per_student_secondary_percent_of_gdp_per_person.csv
Null percentage : 57.26 %
No of countries: 158
edu\literacy_rate_adult_total_percent_of_people_ages_15_and_above.csv
Null percentage : 79.28 %
No of countries: 150
edu\literacy_rate_youth_total_percent_of_people_ages_15_24.csv
Null percentage : 79.59 %
No of countries: 149
edu\pre_school_enrollment.csv
Null percentage : 30.97 %
No of countries: 189
edu\primary_completion_rate_total_percent_of_relevant_age_group.csv
Null percentage : 33.22 %
No of countries: 186
edu\ratio_of_girls_to_boys_in_primary_and_secondary_education_perc.csv
Null percentage : 30.72 %
No of countries: 189
edu\trained_teachers_in_primary_education.csv
Null percentage : 52.91 %
No of countries: 130
edu\trained_teachers_in_secondary_education.csv
Null percentage : 68.15 %
No of countries: 115
edu\children_out_of_school_primary.csv
Null percentage : 33.83 %
No of countries: 197
edu\mean_years_in_school_men_15_to_24_years.csv
Null percentage : 0.00 %
No of countries: 188
edu\primary_school_completion_percent_of_boys.csv
Null percentage : 35.49 %
No of countries: 195
edu\primary_school_completion_percent_of_girls.csv
Null percentage : 35.49 %
No of countries: 195
edu\children_out_of_school_primary.csv
Null percentage : 33.83 %
No of countries: 197

Looking at the values, i narrowed them down to 5.
I didn't want to use mean years in school here, since it is actually used in calculating HDI.
But since there were no other indicator thats reliable so i had to use it.
I just used the indicators for mean years in school for 15 to 24 years, since our goal is predicting hdi in some 30-40 years. 

1. edu\children_out_of_school_primary.csv
    Null percentage : 33.83 %
    No of countries: 197
2. edu\mean_years_in_school_men_15_to_24_years.csv
    Null percentage : 0.00 %
    No of countries: 188
3. edu\pre_school_enrollment.csv
    Null percentage : 30.97 %
    No of countries: 189
4. edu\primary_school_completion_percent_of_boys.csv
    Null percentage : 35.49 %
    No of countries: 195
5. edu\primary_school_completion_percent_of_girls.csv
    Null percentage : 35.49 %
    No of countries: 195
6. edu\ratio_of_girls_to_boys_in_primary_and_secondary_education_perc.csv
    Null percentage : 30.72 %
    No of countries: 189

The other 5 were equally null , so we have to decide to whether keep them or not after calculating their correlation with HDI .
It would be good if they are helpful otherwise we are just using the education index in HDI for this Goal.

I have noticed that the data for all the indicators mentioned in SDG's are actually hard to find and actually most of them are empty.
Even if we do find data thats has less percent of null values, as seen above, some of the countries are missing in these data.
Because of that,  the percentage of null values will increase if we consider all the countries.
So, its better to find data which has more no of countries in it and not just based on null values. 

That's all for selecting the data.
